Drip or Skip, an AI webapp that rates your fit on a scale of drip, mid, or skip, developed in Cornell's 2024 Big Red Hacks Hackathon. This way, you can make sure that you always look your best before stepping out the door. Drip or Skip analyzes your outfit based on style and color coordination, helping you elevate your wardrobe. 
<br/><br/>
Drip or Skip's backend is powered with Flask, and the algorithm uses OpenCV and Pytorch for computer vision. Lastly, we use sklearn's K-means clustering to group the most prominent colors together in the color analysis.
